# Group Project: Virtual Public Sculpture

This repo will be used as the example format for the group project. Any updates regarding structure or directions on content and format will be updated as we work through the different phases. Current tasks as of ... 2/2/22 ... include:

1. Introduction of project including structure of phases, due dates, and weight of final grade.
2. During Week 4 lab students will be instructed on additional git skills including branches.

## Phase 1: Inital project concept - artistic & technical scope

During Week 4 Lab (so yes, due by `end of day` on February 2) you will submit a personal file and demontrate a git branch on your private repo. In this file you will answer a few questions (provided during lab). At the end of Week 4 you will be informed of the final members in your group along with members' preferred contact methods. At that point, you will have until February 14th to submit Phase 1. Updated instructions will be released when groups are made official.

## Remind me about `Git` again .. ?

`Git` is a free, open-source _`version control`_ software. This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So `Git` can be used to store content — and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides. Real life projects generally have _multiple developers working in parallel_. So they need a `version control` system like Git to make sure that there are _no code conflicts_ between them. Also, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of their code. 

The `branch system` in Git allows developers to work individually on a task.

Last week, we could have created three branches in our personal repos - but we didn't. If we had, we might have created:
- one branch for labs
- one branch for quizzes
- one branch for 100 Days

This would be an example of `One branch -> One Topic`.

Instead, we will use the `Git` branch structure to manage our Group Projects and the individual workflows of each student member. So our group project folders will look more like this:
- one branch for Taha
- one branch for Haolin
- one branch for Mehrnaz

This would be an example of `One branch -> One developer`. This will let us _work in parallel_ while still contributing to the _same project_. So! It is important that you feel comfortable with a basic `Git` workflow.

## Some more `Git` refreshing

A repository (or “Repo” for short) is a project that contains multiple files. In our case a repository will contain code-based files. There are two ways you can host your repositories. One is online (on the cloud - our `remote` repos hosted in the `robots-make-art-too` organization here on `GitHub`) and the second is offline (self-installed on your server, or what we refer to as you `local` copy).

### Why so much importance on `Git`

`Git` lets us _track changes in our code across versions_

When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track of revisions — who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration. It’s easy to come back to the previous version and contribute your work. 

For now, we will use our private repos on `robots`. So you should have already `cloned` the `remote` repo you made on GitHub and have a `local` copy on your local device. When you submitted your Quiz and Lab over the last two days you went through at least one of the following: `fetch`, `pull`, and `merge`. 
- when we `fetch` from our `local` copy, we are asking Git to send a copy of all the changes in our `remote` repo that have occured since we last checked. If there were no remote changes, it might seem as if this step did nothing (or on GitHub desk top mentions that there is nothing to `fetch`)
- when we `pull`, Git first completes a `fetch` process _but then applies the changes_ to your local code
- when we `merge`
- 
There are 4 steps in a commit: `status` , `add` , `commit`, and `push`. 

## Phase 2

- to be submitted March 14

## Phase 3

- to be submitted April 14

Where'd I get a lot of this summarized `Git` content? Oh yeah. From that link I posted _the first day_ of [class](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)
